No user action is required.
Microsoft-Windows-VolumeSnapshot-Driver,Information,101,0,Microsoft-Windows-VolumeSnapshot-Driver/Operational,,Stop,,The volume snapshot driver has completed processing for volume online.Volume GUID: {VolumeGuid}Guidance:The volume snapshot driver was able to scan for any persistent snapshots on this volume.You should expect this event when a volume is brought online.  No user action is required.
Microsoft-Windows-VolumeSnapshot-Driver,Error,102,0,Microsoft-Windows-VolumeSnapshot-Driver/Operational,,Stop,,The volume snapshot driver encountered an error while performing processing for volume online.Error: {Error}Volume GUID: {VolumeGuid}Guidance:When a volume is brought online the volume snapshot driver scans for any persistent snapshots that may be on the volume.  In case of an error this scan is not performed.  The error may have originated in storage drivers beneath the volume snapshot driver; check their logs.If the error is STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED this means the volume is in snapshot protection mode and has been taken offline to prevent loss of snapshots.
Microsoft-Windows-VolumeSnapshot-Driver,Information,103,0,Microsoft-Windows-VolumeSnapshot-Driver/Operational,,Start,,Activation of discovered snapshots began.Volume GUID: {VolumeGuid}Guidance:When a volume is brought online or reverted to a snapshot; the volume snapshot driver scans for and activates any persistent snapshots that may be on the volume.You should expect this event when a volume is brought online or reverted to a snapshot.  No user action is required.

Some snapshots may be marked 'visible'; meaning they were exposed as a local volume or file share.  Some detected snapshots may be marked 'deleted'; meaning they are no longer available for use and their diff area space will be reclaimed when all older snapshots are deleted.  Look for instances of event 106 to see each snapshot that was discovered and whether it was 'visible' or 'deleted'.You should expect this event when a volume is brought online or reverted to a snapshot.  No user action is required.
Microsoft-Windows-VolumeSnapshot-Driver,Error,105,0,Microsoft-Windows-VolumeSnapshot-Driver/Operational,,Stop,,Activation of discovered snapshots encountered an error.Error: {Error}Volume GUID: {VolumeGuid}Guidance:When a volume is brought online or reverted to a snapshot; the volume snapshot driver scans for and activates any persistent snapshots that may be on the volume.  Unless the volume is in snapshot protection mode or the error code indicates the volume is offline; a failure during this process results in loss of all snapshots on the volume.

If the snapshot is 'visible'; it was exposed as a local volume or file share.  If the snapshot is 'deleted'; it is no longer available for use and its diff area space will be reclaimed when all older snapshots are deleted.You should expect this event when a volume containing persistent snapshots is brought online or reverted to a snapshot.  If all discovered snapshots are successfully activated you should expect event 104; otherwise you will see event 105.  No user action is required.

The diff area for earlier persistent snapshots is typically read the first time the snapshot is read from.You should expect this event when a volume is brought online; reverted to a snapshot; or when reading from a persistent snapshot for the first time after bringing a volume online.  This event may also occur if a volume is dismounted that contains snapshots that have not been read since the volume was brought online.  No user action is required.

The diff area for earlier persistent snapshots is typically read the first time the snapshot is read from.  The size of the diff area metadata may be less than the total size of the reads (i.e. Size < Count_1MB * 1MB + Count_16KB * 16KB) if the diff area is discontiguous on disk.You should expect this event when a volume is brought online; reverted to a snapshot; or when reading from a persistent snapshot for the first time after bringing a volume online.  This event may also occur if a volume is dismounted that contains snapshots that have not been read since the volume was brought online.  No user action is required.

No user action is required.
Microsoft-Windows-VolumeSnapshot-Driver,Information,114,0,Microsoft-Windows-VolumeSnapshot-Driver/Operational,,Start,,The volume snapshot driver has begun processing for dismount.Volume GUID: {VolumeGuid}Guidance:When a volume is dismounted; the volume snapshot driver closes any handles it may have open on the dismounting volume; such as handles to diff areas.  All auto-release snapshots that have diff areas on the dismounting volume are deleted at this time. The volume snapshot driver may also perform some work to detect whether any future direct writes to the volume are to diff area space for persistent snapshots.  If such writes occur this detection work allows the volume snapshot driver to destroy the snapshots; since the direct volume writes may corrupt them.You should expect this event when a volume dismounts.  No user action is required.
