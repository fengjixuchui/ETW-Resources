(Virtual machine ID {VmId})  Bypassing SCSI command filtering poses a security risk because commands pass directly from the virtual machine to the storage stack on the operating system of the host. This setting is not recommended and should be enabled only if it is required for compatibility with storage applications running in the guest operating system. This setting elevates the rights of the guest operating system by granting it a privilege that is normally restricted to administrators in the host. If the host or other guest operating systems are compromised; or exhibit unusual behavior after enabling this setting; you should disable it. Contact your storage vendor to determine if this setting is required.
