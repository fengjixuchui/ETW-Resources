Schannel  |  Error        |  36869     |  0        |  System   |        |          |           |  The TLS {Type} credential's certificate does not have a private key information property attached to it. This most often occurs when a certificate is backed up incorrectly and then later restored. This message can also indicate a certificate enrollment failure.

The error code is {ErrorCode}. The attached data contains the client certificate.
Schannel  |  Warning      |  36879     |  0        |  System   |        |          |           |  The certificate received from the remote client application was not successfully mapped to a client system account. The error code is {ErrorCode}. This is not necessarily a fatal error; as the server application may still find the certificate acceptable.

Because of this; none of the data contained in the certificate can be validated. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.
Schannel  |  Error        |  36883     |  0        |  System   |        |          |           |  The certificate received from the remote server has been revoked. This means that the certificate authority that issued the certificate has invalidated it. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.

It is therefore not possible to determine whether we are connecting to the correct server. The server name we were expecting is {Name}. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.
